In this practical, we searched for orthologs in different databases and compared the result of different methods. We searched for gene P30143£¬P0AF03£¬P0A6YB using both Graph-based method (Hieranoid, Inparanoid) and tree-based method (PhylomeDB). The three methods predicted quite differently both in the number of the orthologs and the orthologs itself. Some orthologs appear in all three predictions.
